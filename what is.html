<h1> Architectural Design</h1> 
<p>Architectural design is defined as a domain that covers and establishes the needs and bases required to create a living space using specific equipment and ingenuity. <br>The purpose is to conflate the technological and the aesthetic.<br>
Architecture is a creative process that includes multiple phases, one that considers space, geometry, and artistry.<br>
The architectural design contains a diverse range of disciplines that focuses on more than just construction.<br>
The project is complemented to its entire state by an array of subsequent branches. These branches form the basis of this science. <br>Space efficiency, appeal, color theory, sizes, shapes, and how they mix and match.<br><br>
It is classified into three categories:<br>
1.The objects of the design<br>
2.The intention<br>
3.Its aesthetics and technical details<br>
